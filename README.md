# Space Store
This project builds on a simple Express full-CRUD application using Mongoose/MongoDB to persist data for a fictional online store.

Incorporates two models: Products and Users. A simplified inventory/shopping cart system. User authentication and authorization using bcrypt,sessions, and custom middleware.

Additionally, the app links to a text-based browser game called SpaceBattle. Eventually the storefront will evolve to tie directly into the game.

Also, the app will incorporate client-side js for added front-end visual flair and fun.

In the future, the goal is to add error handling, email service for user communication/password reset, logging, and automated testing.

The SpaceStore project is developed by Blake Montgomery, a Chicago-based engineer who currently works as an instructional associate with General Assembly.
